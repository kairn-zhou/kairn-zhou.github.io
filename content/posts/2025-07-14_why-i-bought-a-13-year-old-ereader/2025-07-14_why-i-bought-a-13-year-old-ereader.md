The Kobo Mini was released on September 6th of 2012, making it almost 13 years old as of today. A few months ago, I bought one off Facebook Marketplace for $30.

After bussing for too long to pick it up, I brought it home and realized that making it work would be a lot of work — more that I had anticipated. 

My friend helped me find out that the battery was in dire need of replacement. That was $18.51 and a while of waiting. Once it arrived, I tried my best to install it. This involved filing down the little connector, then realizing I filed it down too much and taping it down. It worked!

Before buying the reader, I did some research. I learned that it might be a good idea to upgrade the memory, so I followed [this](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2462847) post to replace the microSD card. I also learned that Kobo Minis haven't been getting firmware updates since 2016. That meant I needed to manually install the firmware update directly to the microSD card. The Kobo Glo's firmware is compatible with (and supposedly better than that of) the Mini, so I ended up consulting [this](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=2159181) post to install it. Doing so required an SD card reader, so I decided to buy a 7-in-1 USB hub which had a reader among other things.

I also didn't want to have to connect a Kobo account to my device. [This](https://jacobalbano.com/2021/06/24/setting-up-a-kobo-without-logging-in/) post helped me with that, allowing me to proceed without signing in.

After all of that, I just had to download Calibre and find some books to download. There was only a slight learning curve trying to fix metadata discrepancies, which [this](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=351932) post helped me solve. Yay!

Currently I have 21 books on my reader. I downloaded some of my favourite books — by Italo Calvino. I also downloaded Dune, since my friend told me I should read it, and the hard-learned lessons of Herbert's world are feeling quite pertinent to our present.

I am well aware that I could have purchased a much more recent and completely functional secondhand e-reader for this same price, if I so desired. I did not desire such, and am not bothered by the stuff of common user complaints.

Commonly, ereaders receive complaints about "ghosting". This term describes when charged particles in their previous arrangement do not get fully reset, leaving a faint "ghost" of that previous image. I would note that normal books exhibit this behaviour too, as most pages are, to some degree, translucent. I would raise this same comparison in response to complaints of slow page-turning speed, or lack of backlight. 

I bought this Kobo Mini for two main reasons; to be able to read on a compact device that is not my phone, and to gain experience messing with electronics hardware. I find that this little device has successfully fulfilled both of my goals, so I'm happy! I hope this will help me read more, and maybe also save some space since I won't have to store so many books physically.
