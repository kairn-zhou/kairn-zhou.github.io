Recently my friend asked me to make her a website. I don't really do web development or design, but I have been working on my own site (this one here!) so I'm giving it a shot. I am at the stage where I must provide some theme suggestions, so here are some of my favourites that I came across while searching.

# Themes I Would Use
## [Today I Learned](https://michenriksen.com/til-example-site/) by Michael Henriksen
This is the theme I am currently using. I really appreciate how barebones it looks, while still providing thought-through features that are helpful for me. 
- **pros**: minimal, separate posts and notes, sidenote shortcode, graph view, built-in LLM web crawler blocking
- **cons**: few customization options, no night mode

## [Digital Garden](https://digital-garden-hugo-theme.vercel.app/) by Varun Adiyeri Parambath
Designing like this with a "digital garden" framework in mind can create thoughtful structures. In fact, that is one thing I love about the graph view from the previous theme. This theme features a fixed main (side) menu, which I appreciate. My favourite feature, though, has to be the extra fixed sidebar in the "Articles" tab. It reminds me a bit of Andy Matuschak's [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), which I have always admired the flow of. 
- **pros**: not too cluttered, multiple fixed columns
- **cons**: a bit generic, slightly unpolished UI/UX

## [Hugo Apero](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/) by [multiple contributors](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/contributors/)
This is the theme I'll be using for my friend's site. 
- **pros**: smooth style, collections, many customization options
- **cons**: may be too cluttered for some

# Other Mentions
I wanted to include some other mentions here, just in case anyone is looking for some well-maintained traditional-looking sites. They don't quite capture what I'm looking for in a personal website, but they definitely have their strengths.
