Recently my friend asked me to make her a website. I don't really do web development or design, but I have been working on my own site (this one here!) so I'm giving it a shot. Here are some of my favourite themes I came across while searching.

# Themes I Would Use
## [Today I Learned](https://michenriksen.com/til-example-site/) by Michael Henriksen
This is the theme I am currently using. I really appreciate how barebones it looks, while still providing thought-through features that are helpful for me. 
- **pros**: minimal, separate posts and notes, sidenote shortcode, graph view, built-in LLM web crawler blocking
- **cons**: few built-in customization options, no night mode

## [Digital Garden](https://digital-garden-hugo-theme.vercel.app/articles) by Varun Adiyeri Parambath
Unique experiences arise from "digital garden" inspired design. This theme demonstrates just that, with an extra fixed sidebar in the "Articles" tab. It reminds me a bit of Andy Matuschak's [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). 
- **pros**: not too cluttered, multiple fixed columns
- **cons**: a bit generic, slightly unpolished UI/UX

## [Hugo Apero](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/) by Alison Hill and [others](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/contributors/)
This is the theme I'll be using for my friend's site. It's very pretty, and I appreciate Alison Hill's intention of making a theme that is accessible to people who don't have a background in this kind of thing. 
- **pros**: smooth style, collections, many customization options
- **cons**: may be too cluttered for some

# Other Mentions
I wanted to include some other mentions here, just in case anyone is looking for some well-maintained traditional-looking sites. They don't quite capture what I'm looking for in a personal website, but they definitely have their strengths.
