Recently I have been reevaluating my relationships with bigness and smallness.

To the extent that one is in the know regarding world events, it becomes evident that big things are always happening. More than happening — they are piercing, devastating, and affecting real people in the same seconds that the rest of us take to breathe deeply and admire flowers on a July evening.

It seems that when our broader world is facing its largest devastations, us lucky few retreat to the safety of smallness the most. This is an unfortunate reactionary tendency. When online personalities urge their followers to relax, and "appreciate the small things in life", it has started sounding to me like, "ignore all the big things going on". I will refer to this cultural pattern as "small-things-culture".

Upon considering this dynamic, I "broke up" with the idea of focusing on small things. I wanted to give big things the proportional attention they deserve. This is difficult, as such a mindset must primarily be grasped by reasoning against intuition. After all, it comes naturally to us that one blade of grass, carefully examined, invokes a sense of beauty which does not scale to the field (i.e. the field does not feel millions of times more beautiful than the blade, even as the field contains millions of blades). This intuitive tendency is often benign, but can become problematic when applied in other contexts (e.g. "one death is a tragedy, one million deaths is a statistic"). 

On the flip side, I wanted to set a higher standard of hope. While small-things-culture promotes "doing what little you can, even if it's just for yourself", I expect more of myself and others. This is not a projected expectation — rather, it is a reflection of my reality. I hold such expectations because I witness the people around me manage their harsh individual struggles while simultaneously insisting on fighting to uplift others. This community work is balancing; it requires capacity, but it also revitalizes. By subscribing to small-things-culture, it is easy to miss this truth — that doing big work can also make one's individual task of living an easier one, while giving respite to others as well. 

It isn't black and white. Big things are of course made up of many many small things. I couldn't really stop loving small things, I was just searching for a more balanced way to appreciate both. For this, I have been so lucky to encounter Becchi Ayumi Bessho's art.

One of her works lays out small elements in a grid pattern. Each of them are small and unique, and I find them to be beautiful. But a part of their beauty also comes from knowledge of the bigness that Bessho composes by aggregating them together. A castle cannot exist without each stone, and each stone's is elevated by its contribution to the castle. This relationship is of course not unique to Bessho's work, but I believe her work is particularly effective at demonstrating it. 

Recently, Becchi Ayumi Bessho's solo art exhibition launched at [Lucky's Books and Comics](https://luckys.ca/), far from her home in Japan. In *Moon Castle Museum*, her works display peculiar organo-geometric form, with candy-sweet colours arranged in the likeness of tapestry. I already bought her art book at the Vancouver Art Book Fair, but seeing the pieces in person was a completely different and dizzying experience.

Initially, viewers face a overwhelming feast for the eye. The gaze then shifts to analyze the piece's intimate details — while still carrying that initial awe of the whole piece's majesty. Bessho's use of contrast in colour between different elements emphasizes the smallness and individuality of each building-block, but the close enmeshment of these elements with one another assures us viewers that they comprise a whole. Finally zooming out, the viewer is once again faced with the work's grandness — with new appreciation for both the whole and its parts.

Bessho's practice taps into the cultural undercurrent of storytelling and mysticism. It reveals a bubbling and spiralling truth that speaks directly to our inner children — acknowledging attention span crisis, while assuring us that anything becomes interesting upon close examination. These illustrations have helped me realize a mode of viewing that holds the whole and its parts in balance. I maintain my critique of small-things-culture, but I no longer feel that I personally am dismissing the gravity of big things when I recognize the contributions of the small. After all, Bessho's work also reminds us of ourselves; energy cycling, cells generating and re-generating, and bunched together into the shapes of our soft animal bodies. 

I want to draw some contrasts between Bessho's work and the poetry of Mary Oliver (whose work I used to adore, and who is a large figure in small-things-culture). *Wild Geese* may be one of Oliver's most famous works. While well-written, it is hard for me to appreciate in today's climate (see: Marwan Makhoul's [famous poem](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12040969-in-order-for-me-to-write-poetry-that-isn-t-political)). For one, I find the initial claim that "You do not have to be good" to be questionable. The scene that the poem describes is framed with focus on two individuals trading woes. "Meanwhile, the world goes on", relegated to the background. The sun, the rain, the landscapes, the prairies, the deep trees, the mountains, and the rivers — are all glossed over. Finally though, the wild geese are noticed, as they are small just like us. And the poem ends with meditation on this condition of ours.

I understand how a melancholy-stricken teenager would find solace in Mary Oliver's work. In fact, I was that exact teenager. But if I was sent back to cure such a child's unfortunate disposition, I would attempt to broaden their horizons. I would tell them stories of hope and community collaboration as the antidote to most of their despairs. I would show them that it is possible to grieve for their personal tragedies while recognizing that the world is rife with them. I would pull open heavy curtains blocking out the sun to reveal the *Moon Castle*, alongside the harsh blinding realities we must not ignore.
