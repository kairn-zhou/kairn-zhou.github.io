Welcome to my [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). I'm so glad you made it! This is where I'll be growing, [knolling](https://knolling.org/what-is-knolling) and blogging (the latter of which I specify only to indicate my goal of upholding a certain curatorial standard).

As a long-time web-surfer, I have acquired a taste for unique and {{< sidenote "well-designed websites" >}}<a href="/myfavs/#personal-sites">here</a> are some of my favourites{{< /sidenote >}}. I am so excited for the start of this as my very own space to which I can return with ideas collected from interfacing with our serendipitous real world.

## About this site
It's been a really great time actually, making this site. For years, I fruitlessly coveted over the idea of having a personal website. My fear of starting, alongside my penchant for customization — but extreme lack of experience with so much as a terminal — meant that I just never started. Until now!

Several factors converged to allow for my finally starting: having time, having the mental capacity, and coming across [Kepano's workflow](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hi3qff/a_quick_demo_of_how_i_edit_my_website_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Recently, I have been trying to migrate my knowledge management from Notion to Obsidian, so when I saw this possibility of directly editing a site in Obsidian, it seemed pretty perfect. I just had to learn a bit about Hugo, which I had already heard of thanks to this [post](https://probablyalexzhu.github.io/blog/tutorial-how-i-made-this-website-and-you-can-too/) on my friend's {{< sidenote "blog" >}}guess who drew that duck icon{{< /sidenote >}}.
