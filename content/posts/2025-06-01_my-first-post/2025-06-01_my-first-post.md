Welcome to my [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). I'm so glad you made it! This is where I'll be growing, [knolling](https://knolling.org/what-is-knolling) and generally sharing.

As a long-time web-surfer, I have acquired a taste for unique and {{< sidenote "well-designed websites" >}}<a href="/myfavs/#personal-sites">here</a> are some of my favourites{{< /sidenote >}}. I am so excited for the start of this as my very own space to which I can return with ideas collected from interfacing with our world.

# Starting This Site
Making this site has been fun! For years, I fruitlessly coveted over the idea of having a personal website. My fear of starting alongside my penchant for customization, but lack of experience with so much as a terminal... meant that I just never started. Until now!

Several factors converged to allow for my finally starting: having time, having the mental capacity, and coming across [Kepano's workflow](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1hi3qff/a_quick_demo_of_how_i_edit_my_website_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Recently, I have been trying to migrate my knowledge management from Notion to Obsidian, so when I saw this possibility of directly editing a site in Obsidian's Markdown, it seemed pretty perfect.
