Last January, I purchased a typewriter off Facebook Marketplace. I paid $125 for it (if my memory serves me correctly). You can usually get a good quality portable for half that price, but after coming across this machine, I just couldn't stop thinking about it. So this 1956 Brosette became my first typewriter. 

Brosette typewriters are a semi-rare German model of which only about 36 000 were ever produced — much less than the millions of portable typewriters produced by more popular companies at the time. I learned that from [this](https://site.xavier.edu/polt/typewriters/Brosette.pdf) document (which is for some reason often unreachable to me, so [here](/posts/2025-08-13_1956-brosette-typewriter/Brosette.pdf) is a downloaded version), containing compiled information about Brosettes. By reading my machine's serial number, I would be able to find out the year it was produced. But since that's at the bottom of the frame — and I don't want to unscrew it — I will just believe my Facebook Marketplace seller who said that it is from 1956.

I don't have much to share regarding the machine's technical aspects, as I am only a rookie hobbyist. Primarily, I wanted to share some more photos of the machine because there do not seem to be many online.

One thing I really like about my machine is the sticker inside the case lid. I think of a past owner, decorating their belongings as people do. The illustration is by Andreas Paul Weber, who was a German artist born 1893.

I would like to note is that Brosette's creator, Max Brose, was a low level member of the Nazi party. Andreas Paul Weber, though oppositional to Hitler's regime, was also openly antisemetic. I am very much a fan of the well-made machines and compelling illustration made by these men respectively, but education of the violence that underpins so much of what we deem beautiful conditions society for a better future, which I do look forward to.

I don't use my Brosette very often, but doing so is very enjoyable. I love the tactility and unpredictabilities that come with manual lettering. I type letters to my penpal, which has been helpful in breaking me from my habitual veneration of inventory — something I have aimed to move away from this year.

Please enjoy these photos of the machine below.
